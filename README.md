# Truck-Launchtrax

Create a Game-
1. Need to create a truck game, where upon button click will go pick up debris from one corner to another.
2. The path can be a straight line
3. A small UI display as to how much debris has been picked up and how much has been deposited
4. Once all debris has been deposited success message needs to be displayed
5. Models need not be of high quality or detailed but at least should be discernable (differentiable)
6. Need to demonstrate coding capabilities, handling components such as physics and materials and UI.
